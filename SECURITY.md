# Security policy

## Supported configuration

Only the latest `main` revision is supported. Production must run with `INVESTMADE_DEMO_MODE=false`, HTTPS, a private database, dedicated RPC, and secrets supplied by the deployment platform.

## Non-custodial boundary

investmade.fun has no server signing key and cannot broadcast a buy on behalf of a user. World verification is optional and, when configured, proves uniqueness only. It never grants token approval or spending authority.

Privy access tokens are verified by the backend for live requests, and the requested EVM address
must be present in the authenticated user's verified linked accounts. `PRIVY_APP_SECRET`,
`UNISWAP_API_KEY`, and all other provider credentials are server-only deployment secrets.

## Required controls

- Keep `.env`, `.env.local`, API keys, RP signing keys, and database credentials outside Git.
- Rotate any credential accidentally printed, committed, or shared through an insecure channel.
- Terminate TLS at the ingress and preserve secure, `SameSite=Strict`, HTTP-only cookies.
- Restrict database and RPC network access.
- Run `npm audit --omit=dev`, the full CI suite, and the production checklist before release.
- Do not log request bodies for auth, World, 0G, or execution routes.
- Never reuse a Permit2 signature or calldata after a quote refresh.
- Keep stock cards disabled unless Robinhood registry/market/oracle checks, wallet permission, and a live exact-size quote pass.
- Treat the current atomic buy as all-or-nothing. Preserve `PARTIAL` only for legacy/non-atomic records and never relabel `PARTIAL` or `FAILED` as settled.
- Treat “Exit all” as sequential wallet execution, not an atomic basket; stop and report honestly after the first failed call.

## Reporting

Do not open a public issue for a vulnerability involving funds, authentication, secrets, or private user data. Contact the repository owner privately with reproduction steps and impact.
